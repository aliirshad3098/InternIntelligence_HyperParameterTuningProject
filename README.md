# **Loan Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning**  

Loan approval is a crucial process for financial institutions, and machine learning can significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of decision-making. This project focuses on developing a predictive model for loan approval using various machine learning techniques.  

## **Key Aspects of the Project**  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outlier removal, and feature engineering.  
- **Data Visualization:** Identifying trends and relationships between key variables.  
- **Handling Imbalanced Data:** Using oversampling techniques to ensure a balanced dataset.  
- **Model Training & Optimization:** Applying algorithms like Random Forest and hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV, and Optuna.  
- **Performance Evaluation:** Using accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports to assess model effectiveness.  

## **Data Processing & Feature Engineering**  
- **Outlier Handling:** Removing extreme values in numerical features to improve model performance.  
- **Missing Value Treatment:** Filling categorical values with mode and numerical values with mean.  
- **Categorical Encoding:** Converting categorical features into numerical format for model compatibility.  
- **New Feature Creation:** Engineering features like total income, stable income indicator, and debt-to-income ratio to enhance predictive power.  

## **Machine Learning Approach**  
- **Data Balancing:** Oversampling techniques to prevent bias toward the majority class.  
- **Model Selection:** Training and comparing multiple machine learning models.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Using GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV, and Optuna to optimize model performance.  
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the best-performing model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

## **Model Performance**  
After extensive training and optimization, the final model achieved the following performance metrics:  
- **Accuracy:** 96.88%
